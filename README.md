### Source Code

```
It is used to encrypt any kind of binary file(included text files of course!) using addition and subtraction of bytes according to it's position and the byte code of the password. It's extremely safe.(In fact I use it to encrypt zip files of non-parent-flavourable photos in my computer...)
